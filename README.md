# Nanoscope

This module contains ools to read, modify, and plot data from Veeco Nanoscope V5 software.
Input files should be raw data files form the Nanscope software. This had not been tested with 
any other versions of the Nanoscope software, but I suspect it might work.

The `nanoscope.plot_filename()` function is a good example of how to use the package to import, flatten, 
and plot the data.
